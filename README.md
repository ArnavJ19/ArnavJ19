#  Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I'm **Arnav Jain** – a Master's student at **Boston University** with a passion for uncovering insights and driving decisions through **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning**. My work revolves around building predictive models, crafting meaningful visualizations, and leveraging analytical techniques to solve complex business problems.

## **About Me**


I'm a problem solver at heart, always drawn to challenges that require strategy, logic, and creativity. Whether it's building machine learning models, optimizing systems, or uncovering insights from complex data, I thrive on finding smart, efficient solutions.

Beyond work, I love strategy and competition—whether it's playing chess and poker, analyzing soccer tactics, or diving into the precision of Formula 1. I enjoy the mental agility these games and sports demand, much like solving real-world problems.


##  **Highlights of My Work**
1. **Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading**  
   - Built a PPO-based RL agent to optimize trading strategies.  
   - Conducted extensive backtesting to validate risk and reward metrics.  
   - Result: Achieved significant profitability over buy and hold strategy, with 15% higher cummulative returns and 40% higher risk-adjusted returns.   

2. **Clustering-Based Portfolio Optimization**  
   - Developed a robust portfolio using Agglomorative Clustering with stocks of similar risk return profile.   
   - Engineered custom features and performed statistical analysis to understand each stock's impact on risk-return metrics.  
   - Outcome: Optimized portfolio outperformed the Maginificent-7 Stocks and S&P 500 Index with a strong Sharpe Ratio of 1.75 and CR of 35.36%, when backtested on 4 years of Data.

3. **Depression Prediction Using Health Data**  
   - Analyzed public health datasets to predict depression risk factors.  
   - Used machine learning models to improve recall for underrepresented classes.  
   - Result: Achieved a 76% TPR in predicting both classes accurately and low FPR of 21%, which presents model's robustness on real-world data.
